#### Cloud Rresource Optimization using Reinforcement Learning

**Project Summary: Requirements and Step-by-Step Plan**

### **Requirements**
Designing and implementing a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system to optimize resource allocation for training machine learning models on cloud or cluster-based environments. The system should:

1. **Optimize Resource Allocation**:
   - Dynamically manage GPU/CPU utilization and memory allocation during training.
   - Scale resources up or down based on the workload needs (e.g., dataset size, training progress).

2. **Minimize Cost**:
   - Ensure resource usage is cost-efficient by selecting appropriate hardware configurations and minimizing idle resources.
   - Incorporate cost-awareness into the RL reward function.

3. **Optimize Training Time**:
   - Allow users to prioritize faster training by allocating additional resources when needed.
   - Dynamically adjust resources to meet user-defined deadlines for task completion.

4. **Provide Predictive Insights**:
   - For a new dataset, predict training time, resource requirements, and associated costs based on small-scale trials.
   - Provide users with trade-off scenarios (e.g., faster but more expensive vs. slower but cheaper).

5. **Scalability and Adaptability**:
   - Test and deploy the system on a SLURM-based multi-GPU cluster initially.
   - Later transition to AWS, leveraging cloud-based scalability and cost-saving features (e.g., spot instances).

6. **Comparison and Validation**:
   - Compare training performance (cost, time, resource utilization) before and after applying RL to demonstrate improvements.

### **Step-by-Step Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Problem Definition and Baseline Setup**
**Goal:** Define the problem, establish baseline metrics, and prepare the dataset.

1. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - Use the ImageNet dataset (or a subset for feasibility).
   - Preprocess data (e.g., resize images to 224x224, split into training/validation/test sets).

2. **Baseline Metrics Collection:**
   - Train a baseline model (e.g., ResNet-50) using fixed resource configurations (e.g., 2 GPUs, 40GB memory).
   - Record:
     - Training time.
     - Total cost (based on GPU hours and memory usage).
     - Resource utilization (e.g., GPU/memory usage).
     - Model accuracy.

3. **Deliverable:**
   - Baseline performance metrics to compare with RL-optimized training.

#### **Phase 2: RL Framework Design**
**Goal:** Design the RL environment, define states, actions, and rewards, and implement the RL agent.

1. **RL Environment Setup:**
   - Define the state space:
     - GPU utilization, memory usage, dataset size, training progress, etc.
   - Define the action space:
     - Adjust number of GPUs, reduce batch size, release memory, scale up/down resources.
   - Design the reward function:
     - Encourage efficient memory/GPU utilization.
     - Penalize idle resources and prolonged training times.
     - Include cost-awareness to optimize for minimal expenses.

2. **RL Agent Implementation:**
   - Use libraries like **Stable-Baselines3** to implement the RL agent.
   - Train the agent in a simulated environment with a subset of ImageNet to learn optimal resource allocation strategies.

3. **Deliverable:**
   - A trained RL model capable of making resource allocation decisions.

#### **Phase 3: Predictive Resource Estimation**
**Goal:** Build a predictive module to estimate resource needs and costs for new datasets.

1. **Lightweight Training Trials:**
   - Train the model on a small fraction of the dataset (e.g., 10%).
   - Collect metrics:
     - Training time for the sample.
     - Resource utilization and costs.

2. **Prediction Module:**
   - Use the collected metrics to predict full training requirements:
     - Estimated training time.
     - Total cost for different configurations (e.g., 1 GPU vs. 2 GPUs).

3. **Deliverable:**
   - A predictive tool providing resource/time/cost estimates for different scenarios.

---

#### **Phase 4: Scalability and Adaptability**
**Goal:** Ensure the system adapts dynamically to changing workloads and scales across platforms.

1. **Dynamic Resource Adjustment:**
   - Implement real-time monitoring during training to:
     - Reallocate memory or GPUs dynamically.
     - Release unused resources as training progresses.
   - Use the RL agent to make resource allocation decisions in real time.

2. **Scalability to AWS:**
   - Extend the system to AWS by:
     - Using APIs for instance selection (e.g., `p3`, `g4` series).
     - Factoring spot pricing into resource allocation decisions.

3. **Deliverable:**
   - A scalable system tested on both SLURM and AWS platforms.

---

#### **Phase 5: Comparison and Validation**
**Goal:** Evaluate and compare the systemâ€™s performance before and after applying RL.

1. **Before RL:**
   - Train the model using fixed resources (baseline setup).
   - Record performance metrics.

2. **After RL:**
   - Train the model using RL-optimized resource allocation.
   - Record the same metrics.

3. **Comparison Metrics:**
   - Reduction in training time.
   - Reduction in cost.
   - Improvement in GPU/memory utilization.
   - Maintenance of model accuracy.

4. **Deliverable:**
   - Comparative analysis showing improvements in efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

### **How Each Goal is Served**
1. **Optimize Resource Allocation:**
   - Achieved through RL-driven decision-making and dynamic adjustments during training.

2. **Minimize Cost:**
   - Served by designing a cost-aware reward function and predictive estimation of cheaper configurations.

3. **Optimize Training Time:**
