### Below is a complete example in one main file (e.g., main_rl.py) that integrates all functions. This code includes:

Environment setup

Data preprocessing (assumes offline log files are available)

Actor and critic network definitions with twin Q-learning

Adaptive critic reset logic

Training pipeline (offline pretraining and online fine-tuning)

Placeholder function to call external code (e.g., running a VGG16 model on ImageNet45, using your uploaded script)

The code is ```main_rl.py```


## Environment Setup, Running, and Output Guidance
**Setup:**

 -Install Python 3 and create a virtual environment.
 
 - nstall required packages:-

```pip install torch torchvision numpy pandas matplotlib```
Ensure you have access to GPU if available.

**Running:**

Place your offline log files (e.g., 24 CSVs) in a designated folder.

Adjust the CloudEnv class and the data preprocessing functions as needed to load and convert your offline logs.
Run the training script:
```python main_rl.py```


The script will save checkpoints and log metrics (e.g., to metrics.csv).

**Output:**

The training prints episode rewards and periodic logs.

After training, evaluation code (to be added) will generate plots (saved as PNG files) and a LaTeX-formatted results table.

Use the provided plotting functions (e.g., within plot_results.py if added) to generate learning curves and Pareto front comparisons.

**Comparison:
**
To compare with your existing data-model pair code (e.g., the VGG16 on ImageNet45), simply call the external script as shown in the placeholder (os.system("python train-imagenet45-vgg16.py")). This allows you to compare new logs with previous logs.
Plot Generation:

Use matplotlib to plot training curves. For example:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
data = pd.read_csv('metrics.csv')
plt.plot(data['epoch'], data['train_loss'])
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Train Loss')
plt.savefig('learning_curve.png')
```
Similar plots can be generated for cost, SLA, etc., and then referenced in your LaTeX paper.
**LaTeX Integration:**

Include the generated PNG files and tables (e.g., produced as LaTeX code from a Python script) in your final paper.

The LaTeX file provided earlier already contains placeholders for figures and tables.
